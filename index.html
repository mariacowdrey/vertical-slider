                    Michoacán, Mexico!</h1>
                <p>Michoacán is famous for its indigenous peoples, landscape, and major cities like the capital, Morelia, and Patzcuaro.  In spite of the state’s natural beauty, the inhabitants of the region are notably against Cancun-like development.  Instead, the region has a serene air of enchantment. This is one of many reasons why visitors love to witness everyday life there.</p>

                <h1>Janitzio, Michoacán, Mexico</h1>
                <p>While the island of Janitzio is best known for its night of Day of the Dead celebrations (Noche de Muertos takes place November 1 and Dia de Muertos, Day of the Dead and All Souls Day is November 2nd.), it’s worth arriving a day or two earlier to watch the preparations. </p>

                <h1>Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, Michoacán, Mexico</h1>
                <p>Every November, the forest located between the Mexican states of Michoacan and Estado de Mexico is covered in fluttering orange, black, and white wonders. As part of their migration cycle, monarch butterflies fly around 2,800 miles from Canada and the United States to spend the coldest months of the year in warmer lands.</p>
